        <h2>History of Divine Magic</h2>
        The world of [Astavalain “cradle catch divine”] once existed without divine magic. The gods themselves were not known to the intelligent peoples of the surface world, and those magics that did exist were rudimentary and chaotic. Derived from nature and the elements, or brute force and long study. Only few had natural proclivities for the arcane, and these instances resulted more often than not in unintended calamity without a true understanding or control of one’s gifts. 
        It was an accident of fate that first brought the divine touch of the gods to the knowledge of the surface dwellers. As is often the case, the dwarven ambition for plumbing the depths of mines in search of wonder and riches yielded more than anticipated. It was the Duergar of Yeknevolz, an ancient Underdark metropolis, who witnessed (and cowered before) the First God of [Astavalain]. 
        
        <h2>Divine Nexus</h2>
        <p><strong>The Divine Nexus</strong> is the central place of power for all the gods (good, neutral, and evil) where their influence and divine gifts/curses can interface with the material world and those who live in it. Located in <strong>Coravirtus</strong> where the <strong>Crown of the Gods</strong> Divine Trammels (known as the Corona), a series of 18 towers devoted to 18 gods, surrounds the city. 
        <strong>The Corona Towers</strong> are organized thus, from north going clockwise: Pelor, Bahamut, Moradin, Ioun, Sehanine, Erathis, Bane, Vecna, Torog, Asmodeus, Tiamat, Gruumsh, Lolth, Corellon, Melora, Kord, The Raven Queen, Avandra. 
        The binaries are: Pelor vs. Asmodeus, Bahamut vs. Tiamat, Moradin vs. Gruumsh, Ioun vs. Lolth, Sehanine vs. Corellon, Erathis vs. Melora, Bane vs. Kord, Vecna vs. The Raven Queen, Torog vs. Avandra.</p>
